# A whitepaper

(Jan, 2025)
This website serves as an archive/portfolio of my projects and blog posts. It provides a centralized, public place to access my work. As people does, interests, focus and skills change over time. This website is a living document that will be updated as I work on new projects and write new blog posts.

### Navigation

I have divided the website into two main sections:

- **Projects**: A list of my projects.
- **Blog**: A list of my blog posts.

The website is made with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted to keep it simple and lightweight. As having a reduced set of dependencies makes it faster to load and easier to maintain by a single person (me).


I have added a language toggle to switch between English and Spanish. As I want my spanish-speaking friends to still have access to this information. It also serves as a way of reminding me of my Colombian roots.

Because is my website, I can do whatever I want. It also has a dark mode.
